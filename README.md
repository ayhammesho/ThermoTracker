# ThermoTracker
real-time thermo tracker for a client. The project involved retrieving temperature data from an ESP device connected to the backend. The data was continuously updated and displayed on a chart that refreshed every hour. Users had the flexibility to filter the data by days, weeks, months, and years, enabling in-depth analysis and visualization.
